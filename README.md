# Snake Byte

**A classic Snake Feeding Game developed using Flutter.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
  To run the application, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

    Flutter
    Android Studio or Xcode
    

### Installing
  1. Clone this repository:
  
    git clone https://github.com/athulbenny/snake-byte.git
    
  2. Open the project in Android Studio or Xcode.

  3. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.
  

## How to Play
  When the game starts, you will see a snake and a food item on the screen.


  Use the arrow keys to move the snake in the direction you want it to go.

  The goal is to make the snake eat the food item without colliding with its own body.

  Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer and the score increases.

  If the snake collides with its own body, the game ends.

  To start a new game, simply press the start button.
